## **Summary**
This project is an archive of poems published by Bloodaxe Books with six unique ways to search through the different works. First, users may simply browse through the entire archive with various sorting options such as title, author, date, etc. Another search option is by the shape of the work, and the data section links out to other works by authors Bloodaxe Books has published. Lastly, visitors can use the gallery and research sections to view the latest publications of interactive works.

## **Humanities Relations**
The Bloodaxe Archive highlights literature and history as it documents new and old publications of written art. In these areas, the project also promotes education through linking to additional information and the format by which visitors can look through publications. Providing different ways to search for works highlights a new perspective of them, and users can easily find correlations between different pieces based upon which ones are found from a specific search.

## **Use of Technology**
For this particular project, technology is particularly used to narrow searches and categorize publications. 

## **Areas of Excellence**
The creators of this archive link to an education site specifically designed to help visitors navigate through publications and interact with them intuitively. This is an excellent method to provide more detailed guidelines and ideas to explore the site, and this is a way for visitors to gain the most possible knowledge from the project.

Additionally, the greatest and most important strength of this project is the ability to sift through works by unique means. The six avenues visitors can take are rather specific and categorical, implying new ways of looking at publications before they delve any further into the information.

Once an overarching method of searching is selected, users can narrow parameters further with predetermined options, a drawing board, or an open text box. These choices are varied, but they are not overwhelming. This is especially important for people who are not familiar with digital humanities projects. However, the specificity of the options still makes information 

## **Areas of Concern**
As previously mentioned, there is a separate website which serves the specific purpose of helping users navigate the project. Despite its reference, this site is not yet fully functional, and all of the links included lead to an error page.
