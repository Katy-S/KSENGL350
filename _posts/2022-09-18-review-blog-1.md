The visual consists of a large center cirle with a book icon. 5 smaller circles surround this, each with a different icon: brackets, a tringle, the letter "W," a table, and a light bulb. Below this design reads the title "The Bloodaxe Archive."](https://katy-s.github.io/KSENGL350/images/front-page.png)
## **Summary**
This project is an archive of poems published by Bloodaxe Books with six unique ways to search through the different works. First, users may simply browse through the entire archive with various sorting options such as title, author, date, etc. Another search option is by the shape of the work, and the data section links out to other works by authors Bloodaxe Books has published. Lastly, visitors can use the gallery and research sections to view the latest publications of interactive works.

## **Humanities Relations**
The Bloodaxe Archive highlights literature and history as it documents new and old publications of written art. In these areas, the project also promotes education through linking to additional information and the format by which visitors can look through publications. Providing different ways to search for works highlights a new perspective of them, and users can easily find correlations between different pieces based upon which ones are found from a specific search.
