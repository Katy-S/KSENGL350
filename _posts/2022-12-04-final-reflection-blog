## Defining Digtial Humanities
Prior to taking this course, I certainly had my own presumptions of what digital humanities is, but now I understand that most of my original thoughts were incorrect. I first thought the digital humanities was centered around social media and marketing to people with the purpose of advertising the humanities. After taking this class, I define digital humanities as the creative use of technology to teach the public and further research about specific humanities topics. Especially after observing many examples of digital humanities projects, I was able to grasp this unofficially defined subject more firmly.

## Readings
The readings for this class were often helpful in furthering understanding the concepts taught within the curriculum. Perhaps, the highlight of the readings in my experience was learning novel information. I had general knowledge about some of the topics covered in this class, but the readings offered details that I never thought to question.

## Lectures and Discussions
During the meeting times for this class, I found the lectures helpful in reinforcing my learning from the readings. Having Dr. Stover explain parts of articles or assignments and provide examples served as a tremendous aid in my success in this course. 

## Office Hours
I also took advantage of Dr. Stover’s office hours, especially at the beginning of the semester when this new concept of digital humanities was introduced to me. In the first week of classes, I entered Dr. Stover’s office hours with a million questions about the subject. I was anxious because I was unsure how to understand something without a clear definition.  
Dr. Stover walked me through examples and explanations, and she emphasized that digital humanities is something that I would learn to recognize rather than define. Although I struggled with the abstract nature of the concept, I then had a focal point so that I could channel my effort into looking through examples.  
Over time, I was able to recognize digital humanities projects with increased certainty. Additionally, I could identify the characteristics of  projects which categorized them as digital humanities, and I could find aspects of works which deterred them from falling under the definition of digital humanities.

## Assignments
All of the assignments in this class were intentional steps leading up to the grant project. I found most of them to be helpful in this process, but the larger assignments were sometimes challenging and offered confusion. Specifically, the review blogs posed an obstacle at first because I struggled with the concept of the digital humanities throughout the semester. It was difficult to review digital humanities projects while simultaneously trying to understand its defining characteristics. 

## Growth as a Writer
After taking this course, I find that I have grown as a writer and a digital humanist. This class required various specialized forms of writing, all of which I had to adapt. This made my writing skills more versatile, a skill which will undoubtedly help me in the future.  
Before taking this class, I possessed no real knowledge of the digital humanities, and now I understand the goals and purposes of digital humanities and projects.  
This has been an eye-opening class, and I look forward to applying all the knowledge I have gained.
