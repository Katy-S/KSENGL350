## Defining the Humanities
Prior to taking this course, I certainly had my own presumptions of what digital humanities is, but now I understand that most of my original thoughts were incorrect. I first thought the digital humanities was centered around social media and marketing to people with the purpose of advertising the humanities. After taking this class, I define digital humanities as the creative use of technology to teach the public and further research about specific humanities topics. Especially after observing many examples of digital humanities projects, I was able to grasp this unofficially defined subject more firmly.

## Readings
The readings for this class were often helpful in furthering understanding the concepts taught within the curriculum. Perhaps, the highlight of the readings in my experience was learning novel information. I had general knowledge about some of the topics covered in this class, but the readings offered details that I never thought to question.

## Lectures and Discussions


## Assignments
All of the assignments in this class were intentional steps leading up to the grant project. I found most of them to be helpful in this process, but the larger assignments were sometimes challenging and offered confusion. Specifically, the review blogs posed an obstacle at first because I struggled with the concept of the digital humanities throughout the semester. It was difficult to review digital humanities projects while simultaneously trying to understand its defining characteristics.
