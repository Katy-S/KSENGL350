Hi! My name is Katy, and I am a junior this year. My pronouns are she/her.  

I am currently in English 350 to fulfill the writing requirement; however, I chose this topic because the content of working with technology to portray the humanities piqued my interest. As a communication major, I find it imperative to learn about the role technology plays in compiling information and furthering knowledge.  

After undergrad, I intend to join the workforce. My ambition is to specialize in web design and social media (thus, communication major with minors in graphic design and leadership).
