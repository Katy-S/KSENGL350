Hi! My name is Katy, and I am a junior this year. My pronouns are she/her.  

I am currently in English 350 to fulfill the writing requirement; however, I chose this topic because the content of working with technology to portray the humanities piqued my interest. As a communication major, I find it imperative to learn about the role technology plays in compiling information and furthering knowledge.  

Here at CNU, I am a part of the President’s Leadership Program, and I am hoping to join one or two more clubs or organizations this semester. Specifically, I would love to be involved in the Photography Club. I have loved photography since I took an introductory class my freshman year of highschool.

After undergrad, I intend to join the workforce. My ambition is to specialize in web design and social media (thus, communication major with minors in graphic design and leadership). This past summer, I had an opportunity to build an entire website from scratch as a part of my summer internship. Publishing the finished product was a satisfying experience. 

I grew up in Richmond, and I currently live in Church Hill (essentially the most southern part of the city). However, all of my extended family is in Buffalo, New York (go Bills!). As a result, I am very up front and honest, and this occasionally comes back to bite me when living in a more southern culture where I haven’t quite figured out how to beat around the bush.

This semester, I am looking forward to meeting new people, and I am the most excited for my graphic design class. I have not taken an art class since middle school, so I am ecstatic to have the opportunity to learn more in a structured way. So far, so good!
