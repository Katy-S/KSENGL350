## **Summary**
The Torn Apart/Separados digital humanities project serves the purpose of explaining the structure of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement. There are two volumes of this project. The first represents and visualizes data surrounding the locations of holds for immigrants in the country. The second volume addresses more specific questions pertaining to the first volume, namely: money concerns and lodging.  
For the first volume, the data is visualized in the form of orange and purple points across a map of the United States. Each marker indicates either and ICE facility or juvenile detention facility.   
The second volume is also visualized on a map of the United States; however, various regions are marked by color indication of representatives for the area. When users hover the mouse above one of these highlighted places, a box appears with more details about the representative, including how much money they have acquired from the ICE.

## **Humanities Relations**
The Bloodaxe Archive highlights literature and history as it documents new and old publications of written art. In these areas, the project also promotes education through linking to additional information and the format by which visitors can look through publications. Providing different ways to search for works highlights a new perspective of them, and users can easily find correlations between different pieces based upon which ones are found from a specific search.

## **Use of Technology**
For this particular project, technology is used to narrow searches and categorize publications. Specifically, there are links and navigation elements throughout the project to dive deeper into works, sort them, and find ones which are relevant to a visitor seeking something specific. Search options which are predetermine or open-ended allow for either preset learning paths or self-guided discovery.

## **Areas of Excellence**
The creators of this archive link to an education site specifically designed to help visitors navigate through publications and interact with them intuitively. This is an excellent method to provide more detailed guidelines and ideas to explore the site, and this is a way for visitors to gain the most possible knowledge from the project.

Additionally, the greatest and most important strength of this project is the ability to sift through works by unique means. The six avenues visitors can take are rather specific and categorical, implying new ways of looking at publications before they delve any further into the information.

Once an overarching method of searching is selected, users can narrow parameters further with predetermined options, a drawing board, or an open text box. These choices are varied, but they are not overwhelming. This is especially important for people who are not familiar with digital humanities projects. However, the specificity of the options still makes information presentable in a manner that scholars can also utilize effectively to further research.

## **Areas of Concern**
This project is very well executed, and there is always opportunity and space to improve functionality and usability of digital humanities projects. Most importantly for this project, the buttons on the main page do not work. Each displays the title of the corresponding page (Books, Shapes, Research, Words, Gallery, and Data) upon hovering the computer mouse above the buttons, but clicking on these figures yields no result. It is imperative that these icons are clickable to avoid confusion and streamline usage of this project.

As previously mentioned, there is a separate website which serves the specific purpose of helping users navigate the project. Despite its reference, this site is not yet fully functional, and all of the links included lead to an error page.

## **Final Notes**
Overall, this project incorporates modern technology and the humanities in such a way that allows for further knowledge about literature, past and present, published by Bloodaxe Books. The use of navigation elements in this project makes all the difference, and they provide a way for meaningful interactions for both beginners and researchers in the digital humanities.

There are some improvements which can be made to enhance users’ experiences, especially for those who are unfamiliar with the digital humanities. Such adjustments will vastly improve usability and understanding of the project.
